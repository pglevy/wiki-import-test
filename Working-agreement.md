# Process
The team has two streams of work: *planned work* done in regularly scheduled cycles and *unplanned work* picked up in response to business development opportunities.

## Planned work
- Happens in cycles
- Includes a mix of project initiatives and maker materials (tools, templates, frameworks)
- Maybe be delayed by unplanned work

## Unplanned work
- Takes priority over planned work
- May involved people outside the core team
- Will usually be in response to a timely business development effort

# Team members
These are the core members of the team. Other people may augment the team from time to time depending on their availability and skillset and the needs of an engagement.

- Product owner: Philip
- Designer: Kayla
- Design Technologist: TBA

# Meetings
We aim to have as few meetings as possible. The product owner will also shield the rest of the team from external meetings when possible.

Before scheduling a meeting, ask yourself these questions:

- Could this be done over email?
- Could this be done over chat?
- Do I really need this group of people together at the same time?

If you must schedule a meeting, consider using the [mindful meeting invitation](https://github.com/pglevy/mindful-meeting-invitation).

## Working sessions
For the purpose of learning together and sharing knowledge in realtime, we will schedule some working sessions where the purpose is to collaborate or co-create (not just talk).

# Communication
To keep things simple, we primarily use Teams for internal communication and GitHub for external communication. We may also occassionally send emails.

- Ad-hoc, semi-synchronous chat: Teams
- Ideas and Pitches: GitHub Discussions
- Project management: GitHub Projects
- Documentation: GitHub Wiki (public), Teams Files (internal)
- Releases: GitHub Releases

# Time
Work for capture or business development efforts may require a specific billing code. For all other work related to the team, use this code: 

# Definition of Done
Because we will do different types of work, the definition of done will not be uniform, but these are some general principles to apply across all our work:

- It should be reviewed by someone else before shipping.
- It's not "done" until it's shipped.
- It's never really done, but anything we ship should provide a coherent experience.

# Feedback

- If you find a bug, enter it as an Issue.
- If you have an idea for a new project or maker material, start an Idea discussion.
- If you have a fully formed pitch for consideration to take on during a cycle, start a Pitch discussion.
- If you have questions, start a Q&A discussion.

# Project Management
The general approach for planned work is inspired by [*Shape Up*](https://basecamp.com/shapeup) from Basecamp.

## Cycles
The initial work for this team has been defined in 30/60/90-day milestones. See the [roadmap](https://github.com/Bixal/rapid-response-team/projects/1). Beyond that, we will define work in 3-week cycles, with a 1-week break in between them.

## Shaping
Before we commit to doing work during a cycle, it must be *shaped.* That means the *problem discovery* and *problem validation* has already happened. See [Shaping work](https://github.com/Bixal/methods/wiki/Shaping-work) in the Bixal Methods wiki for more details.

## Committing
Committing is the process of deciding what shaped work is added to the cycle.

All work committed to should have a reasonably probability of being completed during the cycle.

All issues will be assigned to a team member.

## Doing
During the cycle, work will be tracked on a GitHub project board.

Team members should keep their assigned issues up-to-date by adding comments and links to latest work, and updating the status on the project board.

All work must be reviewed by another team member before being moved to Done.

## Deploying
Depending on the nature of the issue, some issues may be deployed immediately. Others may be held and packaged into a release.

# Iterating on this agreement
This agreement will be reviewed between each cycle for potential revisions and enhancements.
