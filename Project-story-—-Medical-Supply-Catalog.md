As design opportunities arise in the civic tech community, many agencies find participation difficult due to limited manpower and business constraints. In an effort to mitigate these limitations, Bixal has jumpstarted a cross-disciplinary "rapid response team" to bring value to existing projects by taking the weight off of delivery teams, respond to proposals and their related design challenges, and discover new initiatives. Completed in approximately three days, the first iteration of the prototype explores the potentials of a more adaptable and user-friendly product. The new design consists of a catalog page and some product pages that allow users to view product images, product meta-data, and detailed information in a streamlined structure. The design layout uses the USWDS design system and can be viewed in both Figma, a prototyping tool, and CodePen, an open-source code editor that allows you to see your code in real-time.

## Description
 
### The Problem + Solution

An international agency provides supply-chain logistics for partners around the world. As part of their service, the agency produces a catalog of medical supplies available for order. Currently, the catalog is only available as a PDF file, which causes issues with accessibility, recency of information, findability, and overuse of paper resources. As a proof-of-concept, the solution included two primary pages: a catalog page and an item page.

### Project Constraints

To avoid possible confusion, it was decided to exclude the following features: a category landing page, sorting or filtering features, a functioning search feature, and any client-specific styling or branding.
 
### Building and Designing

During the prototyping phase, solutions were sketched out for both the catalog and product pages. Once these drafts were mocked up and reviewed by team members in Figma, experimentations of a working site were created in CodePen, and the static working site was built on GitHub using Jekyll. A working prototype was presented to the clients after approximately three days of designing and building.

### Page Features

The catalog page displays nine product pages across five distinct categories.  It allows users to see cards with related media images, metadata for the number of products in a category, and the date a category was last updated. For the product pages, users are able to see featured product images, tags for high-level information, a prompt to log in for more information, jump links to full product details, and links to similar products in the category. Some other features that can be found on these pages include a header and footer with indications of navigation and search capabilities.

## Takeaways

- Produced a tangible, working prototype for clients.
- Created reusable content for future projects.
- Shared our work through an open-source approach.
