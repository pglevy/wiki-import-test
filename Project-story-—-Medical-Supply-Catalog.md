Completed in approximately three days, the first iteration of the prototype explores the potentials of a more adaptable and user-friendly product. The new design consists of a catalog page and some product pages that allow users to view product images, product meta-data, and detailed information in a streamlined structure.
 
## The problem and solution

An international agency provides supply-chain logistics for partners around the world. As part of their service, the agency produces a catalog of medical supplies available for order. Currently, the catalog is only available as a PDF file, but this can cause some issues:

- Accessibility to the catalog
- Recency of information 
- Findability 
- Overuse of paper resources

As a proof-of-concept, our team built a prototype that would include a redesign for two primary pages: a catalog page and a product page.

## Page features

The catalog page displays nine product pages across six distinct categories with the following included:

- Cards with related media images
- Metadata for the number of products in a category
- The date a category was last updated

On the product pages, the following are included:

- Featured product images
- Tags for high-level information 
- A prompt to log in for more information
- Jump links to full product details
- Links to similar products in the category

Some other features that can be found on these pages include a header and footer with indications of navigation and search capabilities.

## Additional changes

After receiving client feedback, we performed a second iteration and made the following changes:

- Added an "Add to list" button to the product page.
- Added "last updated" along with some other metadata to the product page. 
- Added a language selector.
- Added category landing pages.

## Takeaways

- Produced a tangible, working prototype shared with our client.
- Crafted a reusable prototype template for similar projects.
