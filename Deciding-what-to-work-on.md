Consider these factors when deciding what [planned work](Working-agreement#process) to take on: relevance, scope, benefits. The product owner will make the final call on what to add to the cycle.

## Relevance
- What portofolio does it align to?
- Which clients is it relevant to?
- Is this is a good time?
- How does it align to team principles? (speed, tangibility, reusability, openness)

## Scope
- What problem are we solving?
- How important is the problem?
- What version of this can we comfortably commit to completing during a cycle?

## Benefits
- What capabilities can we demonstrate?
- What technologies are we using?
- How does this support our overall objectives?
